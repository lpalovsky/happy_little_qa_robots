# Happy little qa robots
```
“We don't make bugs, just happy little accidents.”
```
```
“There's nothing wrong with having a robot as a friend.”
```
```
“If what you're doing doesn't make you happy, you're doing the wrong thing.”
```
```
Friends are the most important commodity in the world. Even a robot needs a friend.
```
```
“All you need to QA is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.”
```

```
“Lets build a happy little cloud.
Lets build some happy little robots.”
```
